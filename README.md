INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a GitHub page for the MA-DTA Thesis of Isaac in the University of Antwerp.

experiment_diff_representation are the codes with different models.

internship_ml_data3 has the news comment data used for training and testing

newscontent and newstitle have more details of the news comments

I recommend running the codes on Google Colab rather than Jupyter. We have seen issues with Jupyter with the same code that runs fine in Google Colab.
