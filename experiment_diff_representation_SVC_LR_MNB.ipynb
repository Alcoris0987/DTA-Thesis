Photograph: Courtesy of Fitzcarraldo\\n\\nIn a totalitarian system where even ideas are punishable with imprisonment, this collection of essays from one of Egypt’s most high-profile political prisoners is like an oasis in a desolate landscape. Part manifesto, part memoir and part record of some of Abd El-Fattah’s trial scenes that are more than worthy of Kafka, the book contains passages smuggled out from Cairo’s infamous Tora prison.\\n\\nAbd El-Fattah has been detained repeatedly, and held in a maximum-security facility indefinitely without charge since 2019. “When I demand my right to read and write, I am not demanding a luxury. Rather, I am asking to be allowed to live in this age,” he tells a prosecutor, while still unable to know the charges against him. He is also denied access to reading materials, making this book all the more powerful.\\n\\n“The text you are holding is living history,” Naomi Klein declares in her foreword. The pages of You Have Not Yet Been Defeated are a journey through the uprising of 2011, autocracy and ultimately hope.

Photograph: Courtesy of North Carolina Press\\n\\nAt first sight, Lula and His Politics of Cunning appears to be a book about Brazil’s past: the storybook tale of a sharp-witted union leader who rose to become “the most popular president in the history of Brazil and perhaps the world”.\\n\\nBut French’s masterly account of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s journey from rural poverty to the Brazilian presidency – and his subsequent downfall – is infused with the present and the future. “The story is not yet over,” French writes of his 76-year-old protagonist, who looks poised for a sensational political comeback in next year’s presidential election.\\n\\nThe looming showdown between the leftist Lula and his far-right arch-rival, Jair Bolsonaro – elected in 2018 after Lula was jailed by a judge who went on to work for Bolsonaro – hovers over French’s biography. The author’s contempt for the current president – whom he calls a “fascistic far-right troll” – is also clear.\\n\\nBut the star of the show is the grit and sagacity of a politician who once likened himself to a Brazilian pit viper called the jararaca.

In this compelling book by the award-winning Indian journalist Josy Joseph, it is not India’s political leaders who are under the spotlight but the murky workings of India’s deep state, from the police to the federal investigative and intelligence agencies.\\n\\nTraversing incidents such as the Mumbai train blasts, the Kashmir insurgency, the Gujurat “war on terror” and the Delhi riots, Josy depicts, through a variety of colourful characters, how corruption and political agendas run through the core of the agencies that should be responsible for justice and accountability, subverting democracy in the process.\\n\\n“India no longer feels like a democracy. The contract of trust between citizens and law enforcers is permanently broken,” he writes. “In most parts, Indian society is adrift in lawless waters.”\\nHannah Ellis-Petersen\\nThe Silent Coup is published by Context, an imprint of Westland publishing house\\nAfrica\\n\\nYouthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World\\nBy Edward Paice\\nCover of Youthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World\\nAfrica’s demographic changes ‘will be one of the most significant global shifts in the coming decades’, according to Edward Paice. Photograph: Courtesy of Head of Zeus\\n\\nA common stereotype about Africa is that it is a ticking timebomb; its population is exploding, threatening to “swamp” Europe with an ever-increasing “flood” of illegal immigrants. There is another less common but equally misleading stereotype that the growing youth population, the “democratic dividend”, will lead to economic miracles as the energetic under-25s, who make up 60% of Africa’s population, will generate spectacular growth as people elsewhere in the world age and decline.\\n\\nYouthquake turns both the doom-laden and rose-tinted narratives on their heads. This meticulously researched, nuanced and careful book brings a voice of reason to the debate. The fact that Africa comprised 10% of the world’s population in 1980 and is projected to make up 25% of it by 2050 will have immense and complex consequences for the continent and the rest of the world.\\n\\nThe book explores in compelling detail the positives, the negatives and all the bits in-between of what will be one of the most significant global shifts in the coming decades. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand Africa and its place in the world.\\nMary Harper, BBC Africa editor and author of Getting Somalia Wrong?

Photograph: Courtesy of Sang-e-Meel\\n\\nIn 1984, when Pakistan’s Thar desert was largely inaccessible to outsiders due to a lack of roads, the travel and history writer Salman Rashid could be seen negotiating his way across its dunes in a 4x4. Today, life in the rural areas of Pakistan is as unfamiliar and alien to the country’s urban residents as it is to foreigners. Mithi: Whispers in the Sand, an account of Rashid’s explorations in Sindh’s Tharparkar district between 1984 and 2017, provides a nuanced understanding of the sensibilities and habits of local people through a series of detailed interviews.\\n\\nRashid notes that the communities in every village and town in the district are “remarkably cohesive”, with Hindus and Muslims coexisting peacefully in the same areas and demonstrating a spirit of unity.\\n\\n“We are growing in numbers, but God has stopped making more land,” says Kheth Singh, a Rajput elder, as he expresses concern over the felling of trees when land is brought under cultivation. He refers to the village of Keetri, where locals have banned cutting down trees or plants.\\n\\nRashid also attempts to weave a historical narrative, comparing the reports of colonial administrators with locals’ oral histories and his own archaeological findings. He refers to the published observations of the English merchant Nicholas Withington, who was robbed endlessly while travelling through the area in the winter of 1613-14 and left with barely even his clothes.\\nAli Bhutto\\nMithi: Whispers in the Sand is published by Sang-e-Meel\\nThe Middle East\\n\\nOur Women On The Ground: Essays by Arab Women Reporting from the Arab World, Edited by Zahra Hankir\\nCover of Our Women On The Ground: Essays by Arab Women Reporting from the Arab World\\nZahra Hankir edits this collection of writings by female correspondents reporting from their homelands. Photograph: Courtesy of Vintage\\n\\nThis memoir collection is a refreshing insight into living and working in some of the world’s most dangerous places. Nineteen female storytellers – all journalists from the Middle East, or with family links to the region – share their experiences of reporting in their homelands, whether in peacetime, on the frontlines, or in the thick of revolutions. In doing so, they upend our understanding of what it means to be a foreign correspondent.\\n\\nOur knowledge of the Middle East is richer and more nuanced thanks to these courageous women; it is long past time that we looked at things from their perspectives. What it means to love, and to fear for those we love, echoes throughout these stories. Even if you have never set foot in Syria, Egypt or Yemen, everyone can relate to that.\\nBethan McKernan\\nOur Women On The Ground is published by Vintage\\nNigeria\\n\\nFormation: The Making of Nigeria from Jihad to Amalgamation,\\nBy Fola Fagbule and Feyi Fawehinmi\\nCover of Formation: The Making of Nigeria from Jihad to Amalgamation\\nThis account of the origins of Nigeria reads ‘like a historical novel’. Photograph: Courtesy of Cassava Republic Press\\n\\nFagbule and Fawehinmi’s book reads almost like a historical novel in which a cast of unlikely characters acting independently over time brought about a series of unlikely events that culminated in the emergence of Nigeria as a country. Chief among these characters were the two lovelorn figures of Frederick Lugard and Flora Shaw who, after severe heartbreaks, found solace in each other in their 40s and were midwives in the birth of Africa’s most populous nation in 1914.\\n\\nWhile many Nigerians today see the country as the flawed tapestry of Lugard and Shaw’s broken dreams, Formation argues that from the 1800s, when the Oyo empire in the south collapsed and the jihadist empire of Dan Fodio rose in the north, regardless of the intervention of the two colonialists, Nigeria as a country was on the verge of emergence.\\n\\nTold in clear, precise prose, this is a rare history book written by two young finance executives that moves Nigeria’s narrative in a different and exciting direction for the 21st-century reader.\\nAbubakar Adam Ibrahim’s latest book, Dreams and Assorted Nightmares, is published by Masobe Books.\\nFormation: The Making of Nigeria from Jihad to Amalgamation is published by Cassava Republic Press\\nNepal\\n\\nAll Roads Lead North: China, Nepal and the Contest for the Himalayas\\nBy Amish Raj Mulmi\\nCover of All Roads Lead North: China, Nepal and the Contest for the Himalayas\\nNepal’s geopolitical shift away from India, its giant southern neighbour, towards the regional superpower, China, is explored by Amish Raj Mulmi. Photograph: Courtesy of Hurst\\n\\nAmish Raj Mulmi’s book describes the recent pivot by Nepal from south to north. In 2008, with Nepal’s monarchy in the dustbin of history, the new Maoist prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, chose to go first not to Delhi but to Beijing to attend the Olympics, provoking a sharp intake of breath from Indian policy strategists.\\n\\nThat process has only gathered momentum with Nepali political leaders sympathetic to China gaining ground and talk of a high-speed rail link between China and the Nepali capital, Kathmandu. There has been growing pressure too on the Tibetan diaspora living within Nepal.\\n\\nMulmi’s detailed look at Nepal’s long encounter with Tibet and China is leavened with personal experiences but the message is clear: Modi’s bullish nationalism does not play well in Himalayan capitals.\\nEd Douglas is the author of Himalaya: A Human History\\nAll Roads Lead North is published by Hurst\\nThe Philippines\\n\\nThe Philippines is Not A Small Country\\nBy Gideon Lasco\\nCover of The Philippines is Not A Small Country\\nGideon Lasco’s book is a ‘love letter’ to his compatriots but also a good read for non-Filipino readers who want to better understand the country.

Why do they keep electing bad leaders?

Lasco, a medical anthropologist, wants his compatriots to redirect their energies into understanding the country’s vicious cycle of poverty and bad governance – correcting some misconceptions along the way – so they may find a way out of it.\\n\\n“In the process of writing and curating this manuscript, I was especially mindful of young Filipinos, many of whom are unsure as to what the future brings, uncertain as to what to make of their national identity, and unclear as to how to critically engage with our nation’s problems,” Lasco wrote in his introduction.\\n\\nLasco’s musings make it a good read for non-Filipino readers who want to better understand the idiosyncrasies of the country and its people.\\nCarmela Fonbuena\\nThe Philippines is not a Small Country is published by Bughaw, an imprint of the Ateneo de Manila University Press\\nVietnam\\n\\nShip of Fate: Memoir of a Vietnamese Repatriate\\nBy Trần Dình Trụ\\ncover of Ship of Fate\\nTrần Dình Trụ’s memoir tackles the complex, traumatic experiences of people desperate to flee their homeland, yet also umbilically tied to it. Photograph: Courtesy of University of Hawai’i Press\\n\\nAfter the takeover of Saigon by Vietnamese communists in 1975, a million refugees – Trần Đình Trụ included – fled Vietnam, often in flimsy fishing boats. It is estimated that half of them drowned at sea in their attempt to seek refuge in south-east Asia before resettling in the west. Although Trụ managed to escape, his heart remained in Vietnam, where his wife and children had been left behind. So, along with 1,500 Vietnamese repatriates, Trụ decided to return.\\n\\nOn his arrival, he was imprisoned in a “re-education camp” for 13 years, suffering gruelling labour and torture. Written in 1991, when he and his family finally resettled in the US, Trụ offers a rare Vietnamese perspective into both the chaotic fallout of the Vietnam-US war – and the private war raging inside him as he witnessed the loss of his homeland. “We are all just water lilies, carried by the current without ever knowing where the river flowed.”\\n\\nThis is not a new book – although the English translation is only from 2017 – yet it resonates with our current era, tackling the complex, traumatic limbo experienced by the many desperate people fleeing conflict today.\\nGeorgina Quach\\nShip of Fate is published by University of Hawai’i Press\\n\\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:',\n"," '/p/kxdhg': 'Could he?

It’s an unexpected twist, like if King Lear contained a weird new beat where Lear hands the British crown to Jack Dorsey for a laugh, but it sets up a bold new future for the show. What will happen in season four? Here are some theories.\\nEverything stays the same\\nRoman Roy.\\nPhotograph: Graeme Hunter\\n\\nSeason three of Succession picked up seconds after season two ended. It was a smart move, showing the immediate swirl of confusion that followed Kendall Roy’s decision to undo his father, and something similar could happen here. This week’s episode ended with three of the Roy siblings heartbroken and angry at their father’s grand betrayal. Perhaps season four could pick up at that precise moment, and show their efforts to reorganise their rebellion against him. This is something that Succession undoubtedly does very well – for the most part, its greatest moments have been those heart-thumping scenes where Kendall scraps for support to unseat his dad – and Jesse Armstrong has more than enough dramatic clout to centre the entire season around the battle to stop the Matsson deal dead in its tracks.\\nLogan sells up, part one\\nLogan and Roman talk with Mattson Kriti Fitts.\\nPhotograph: Graeme Hunter\\n\\nThat said, we’ve seen that scenario, or versions like it, play out countless times before. Perhaps it would be more dramatically satisfying to start season four a little down the line. Logan has sold Waystar to Matsson and is now a (moderately) powerless figurehead. Matsson, meanwhile, has the reins and is set upon disruption. And then there are the Roy kids, all fighting to earn their spots in the company. There’s a contingent of Succession fans – I confess to being one of them, from time to time – that has long been desperate to see how the kids would cope without the entitlement that comes from having their dad as their boss. If all the excruciating psychodrama of being in the family business fell away, would they thrive? Would they sink? Would they spend their lives fruitlessly plotting to overthrow their new boss, just as they did with their dad?\\nLogan sells up, part two\\nShiv Roy.\\nPhotograph: HBO\\n\\nThe alternative, and one that runs the risk of alienating the audience, is to just pretend that Waystar Royco doesn’t exist. Matsson has breezed in and sacked everyone, and is now running it as his own little dictatorship without the participation of any of the Roy family. Suddenly the central theme is the total absence of the family company. Is Logan Roy capable of being a contented retiree, or would his hunger for professional violence send him mad? Would Shiv re-enter the world of politics? Kendall has experience of existing outside of Waystar, so could this new environment be his path to rebuilding his fractured self-esteem? What in the world would Roman do? All the all-time great shows have a season like this, where the lead characters find themselves ripped from the comfort of their surroundings – Mad Men broke Sterling Cooper, Tony Soprano separated from Carmela, Lost hit a nuclear bomb with a rock and everyone went back in time – and there has never been a better chance for Succession to follow the pattern.\\nThe ascent of Wambsgans\\nTom Wambsgans.\\nPhotograph: Graeme Hunter\\n\\nReally, though, I suspect that all anyone really wants to see from Succession is the continued dominance of Tom Wambsgans. For years, Tom has been a figure of ridicule – his wife doesn’t love him, and her family views him as nothing but a socially climbing freeloader – and so his late-stage betrayal in the season three finale was an air-punching moment of true elation. The nod from Logan in the dying moments appeared to signal a new period of triumph for Tom. Perhaps, with Logan out of the picture, Tom could be Succession’s primary antagonist; a figure who has taken everything the Roy kids felt entitled to, and is eager to rub it in their faces at every turn. Would Tom do well in the upper echelons of power? No, of course not, he’d be a disaster. But try telling me you wouldn’t want to watch that.\\n\\nThis article was amended on 5 January 2022.

Photograph: Jody MacDonald\\n\\n‘He had been used for logging on the Andaman Islands. When I found him, he was 60, living in retirement – and loving his swims’\\nInterview by Graeme Green\\nWed 8 Dec 2021 15.27 GMT\\nLast modified on Wed 8 Dec 2021 18.52 GMT\\n\\n122\\n\\nI lived at sea for 10 years. I co-owned and ran a global kiteboarding expedition business. We’d sail around the world on a 60-foot catamaran, following the trade winds, kiteboarding, surfing and paragliding in remote locations. One night, I watched a Hollywood movie called The Fall, which had a section where an elephant was swimming in tropical blue water. I didn’t know if it was real or a fake Hollywood thing. But I thought: “Man, if that does exist, I’d love to photograph it.”\\n\\nI searched the internet and found the elephant from the film was living in the Andaman Islands, an Indian territory in the Bay of Bengal. When we sailed into the capital, Port Blair, a few months later in 2010, I decided to hop off and try to find this elephant. I found Rajan on Havelock (now Swaraj) Island and spent two weeks with him, learning about his incredible story.\\n\\nRajan was brought to the Andamans with nine other elephants in the 1970s to help log the islands. They needed a way to get the cut trees out to the barges just off the islands, so the elephants were forced to learn how to swim in the ocean. Elephants love fresh water but they don’t like salt water because the salt stings their eyes and dries their skin. The elephants would drag the giant cut badak trees and swim them out to barges. Once an island was logged, the elephants would be made to swim to the next island. They’d sometimes swim miles, which was mind-blowing: a group of 10 elephants swimming in open ocean.\\n\\n    He’d totally immerse himself and use his trunk like a snorkel which was so cool\\n\\nWhen logging was banned in 2002, Rajan was out of a job. He was the last elephant of the group to survive and lived out his days on Havelock Island until his death in 2016. When I found him, he was around 60 years old, living out his retirement with Nazroo, his caretaker, who in India is called a mahout.\\n\\nEvery morning, Rajan would go into the jungle or walk down to the beach. He went swimming whenever he felt like it. He seemed to have adapted to swimming in salt water and even to enjoy it. I truly felt like he was having fun swimming in the ocean. I think that comes across in this picture. Many people tell me it looks like he’s smiling.\\n\\nAt times, he’d wade into the water a little bit and decide not to swim, and other times he’d submerge himself completely and swim out into deeper water, like someone doing laps in a pool. He’d totally immerse himself and use his trunk like a snorkel, which was so cool.\\n\\nIt’s surreal to swim with an elephant, especially in tropical blue water. I remember thinking, “Wow, this is crazy that I’m here witnessing this.” Often, Rajan was in shallower areas. But I really hoped to get a photo of him swimming weightlessly in deeper water, his legs kicking freely, in doggy paddle motion. It was challenging because I was always having to try to stay clear of him and his movements were unpredictable, which made it difficult to anticipate where he was going to swim. It all came down to whatever mood Rajan was in. On the day I took this photo, I was with him on one of his longer swims and I used a weight belt to freedive down to get the angle I wanted.\\n\\n    His previous caretaker, who had done all his brutal logging training, had died from a cobra bite\\n\\nRajan’s mahout was always nearby. He felt so comfortable with Nazroo and didn’t want to be far from him. His original mahout, who was the one who had done all the brutal training, had died from a cobra bite, and Nazroo came in after that. I’ve worked on human-elephant conflict for a few years in Asia and I’ve done stories on mahouts in India, so I’ve seen different levels of the relationship between humans and elephants, but I’ve never seen a bond as strong as Rajan and Nazroo’s. It was like watching a mother and child – a caring, loving relationship.\\n\\nSpending time with Rajan was an amazing experience. Rajan was probably the last ocean-swimming elephant we’ll ever see, which gives the image extra poignancy. As logging bans have increased, using elephants for logging has significantly diminished. I think it still happens in some Asian countries, but it’s a practice that’s thankfully fading.\\n\\nI’ve had incredible experiences as a photographer. I think it’s important to share those experiences to encourage and inspire people to get out of their comfort zone and have their own adventures. It not only enriches their own lives but strengthens their relationship with nature and the environment, which means they’ll be more inclined to protect them.

I don’t want to be the badass’ – Noomi Rapace on beating her Dragon Tattoo traumaThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo brought her global fame but trapped her in ‘pain and sadness’. The actor reveals how starring in weird new thriller Lamb made her feel alive again\\nThu 2 Dec 2021 06.00 GMT\\nLast modified on Tue 7 Dec 2021 09.51 GMT\\n\\n232\\n\\nNoomi Rapace – the original Lisbeth Salander, AKA The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo – is sitting in the hotel bar with her sunglasses on top of her head. They disappear at some point during our conversation, though I don’t see them go. I do notice, however, when her black jacket, which has been draped around her shoulders, falls to the floor while she is flapping her arms pretending to be an eagle. This happens shortly after she has told me how she once wore a strap-on dildo in public. She really is a lot of fun and quite naughty.\\n\\nWe were due to meet in a windowless room upstairs but she wanted a window. “They’d put us in a little prison cell,” she huffs, now looking out on to the back streets of London’s Mayfair. “I was like, ‘I can’t be stuck in there!’ It’s all about flows and energies.” The double espresso she asked for when she first got here has yet to arrive, so she orders another from a passing staff member, who brings it in a flash. Rapace, who is 41, does a quick inventory: “Window. Coffee. Ryan. Perfect.” Then her original order arrives. She looks up at her server in astonishment. “Is this ours? I love your lipstick, by the way, it’s really pretty.” She turns to me. “Do you want this? Let’s have it.” The next time I look down, both cups are empty.\\n\\nThis is all worlds away from the forceful minimalism she brings to the unsettling new indie thriller Lamb. She plays Maria, who lives with her husband on a farm in the Icelandic countryside. It’s just the two of them, their sensible knitwear, their animals, and the unspoken pain of the past. “It’s like a family drama,” she says. “But with one obstacle that is a bit strange.” That’s putting it mildly. When a sheep on the farm gives birth to a half-human, half-lamb hybrid, the couple name her Ada, rock her like a baby, and adopt her as their own. Meanwhile, Ada’s birth mother stands outside, bleating sinisterly, refusing to budge.\\n\\n“I had nightmares about her,” gasps Rapace. “We had this strange energy between us. She was always looking me straight in the eye, ‘Baaaa, baaaa.’ Enough! The noise got in my dreams. I went outside to try to connect with her and she was stomping on the ground. It felt like she was a direct threat to my happiness. I hated her.” The director, Valdimar Jóhannsson, worried sometimes that Rapace had gone a bit too deep. “He said I was more Maria than Noomi.” No kidding.\\n‘It gave me nightmares’ … Rapace in Lamb, about a sheep that gives birth to a half-human.\\n‘It gave me nightmares’ … Rapace in Lamb, about a sheep that gives birth to a half-human. Photograph: A24/Allstar\\n\\nThis film, an elemental human-against-nature struggle, means more to her than most. “I feel like I’ve been waiting for it for as long as I can remember,” she says. “My body was telling me, ‘This is what you need. To dig down into the soil and lava of Iceland.’” Although born in Sweden, Rapace spent three years on a farm in Iceland from the age of five: her mother and stepfather worked there in a community for young adults with Down’s syndrome. When the family moved to another farm back in her home country, she pined for Iceland. “I had a very strong love story with it from the first time I set foot there. I was always an outsider in Sweden: I was too much, too emotional, too passionate.”\\n\\nShe started acting while still in Iceland, getting her first film job there at the age of seven, in the medieval saga In the Shadow of the Raven. “I felt like I’d been invited to paradise. There was freedom on set. I didn’t have to be cute. I’ve always revolted against cuteness and the need to be likable, because I’m not.” A few minutes later, she corrects herself: “Actually, I’m desperate to be liked. That’s the problem. My need to be accepted into the nice sophisticated rooms was so strong that I had to make a conscious decision, ‘OK, I don’t want to be liked.’ Otherwise I would be a slave to that. I’ve even written a manifesto to myself as a reminder that I can’t do things just to be liked.” She emails it to me later: this punchy, 500-word pep talk is the sort of thing one might read to get psyched up before stepping on stage or into the ring.\\n\\n    I put on a big strap-on dildo and walked round the club like a man all night. I loved it!\\n\\nIf ever there was a role designed to prove that she was nobody’s poppet, it was Lisbeth Salander, the snarling, punky, motorbike-riding, golf-club-wielding avenger from Stieg Larsson’s Millennium novels. Arthouse audiences already knew that Rapace meant business from films such as Daisy Diamond, where she plays a young mother who drifts into sex work. But it was Swedish-language adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2009) and its two sequels that introduced her to the world. Mention this and she grimaces at how people still confuse her with Salander.\\n\\n“I don’t want to be the badass,” she groans. “I even hate the word. People are always pitching things to me, ‘She’s so badass, she’s so you.’ I’m like … ” She puts her head in her hands. Making those films, she says, was “like drowning in trauma. It meant that the first connective tissue between me and the world was pain for many years. Pain and sadness was like my identity card. Now I’ve healed a lot. Maybe I’m not lighter but I would say I allow more colours in me. I feel looser. The veneer, the shield I’d built up since childhood, is slowly peeling off. I’m alive now rather than surviving.”\\n\\nShe accepts that the word “badass” can still be applied to some of her actions: aborting her own alien baby in Ridley Scott’s Prometheus, before leaping off the operating table as if she had just enjoyed a quick disco nap, was about as badass as it gets. “That I like,” she laughs. “Look, I really don’t take myself as seriously as people think. My friends all know I’m stupid and nerdy.” Like how? “Well, I’m always doing this.” She folds her top lip under itself and sticks out her front teeth. “My friends are like, ‘Can you please stop?’”\\n\\nAnything else? “A director and producer came over to work with me and I took them to a club where the theme was cross-dressing. I put them in wigs and long dresses, and I was a full-blown man. I was wearing this dildo, this big strap-on, and I was walking round like a man the whole night. I loved it!”\\nRapace with Michael Nyqvist in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\n‘I’ve always revolted against cuteness’ … Rapace with Michael Nyqvist in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Photograph: Nordisk Film/Sportsphoto/Allstar\\n\\nSince she associates Salander with suffering and trauma, it’s no wonder she wants to move on. Each of her movies, she explains, represents a clear chapter in her life, whether it’s 2014’s The Drop, an impressively tender crime drama with Tom Hardy, or the Will Smith’s 2017 fantasy thriller Bright, in which she played an evil elf whose minions eat babies. She need only watch a few seconds of one of her old films to remember her state of mind: “What my fears were, what I was struggling with.”\\n\\nIn 2011, she starred with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law in Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes reboot. “If I watch that now I can see I was in the middle of my divorce. I can see it in my face, hear it in my voice. I can see my chest is locked. I can see that was a day where we had a big argument that morning, or I hadn’t slept the entire night. Making both Sherlock Holmes and Prometheus, I was coming out of my divorce, and life was really chaotic.”\\n\\nHer ex-husband, and the father of her 18-year-old son, is the Swedish actor Ola Rapace, formerly Pär Ola Norell. They both changed their surnames when they married; hers was Norén. Is this a Swedish custom? “No. I just didn’t feel connected to my name and I wanted to start something new and beautiful.” Rapace, she says, means “bird of prey”; the choice can be traced back to an experience she had in Iceland when she was seven. “I was playing with ice rocks and I felt this presence. I look up and this huge eagle is sitting close by, staring at me with golden eyes. I thought either he was going to take me or attack me or bless me for life. And then – ba-boom, ba-boom – he took off and flew away.” She flaps her arms. Her jacket hits the floor.\\n\\n“I felt like it was a god. Later, I did some research and found out that eagles are incredibly loyal. That’s like me – and that’s something I tapped into on Lamb. I have this primal animal side. If I go to battle for you, I promise I’ll fight until I die!” I believe her. I have no doubt she would make a formidable ally. But for now: no more coffee.\\n\\nLamb is released in the UK on 10 December.\\n\\nThis article was amended on 2 December 2021 to clarify that it was the 2009 Swedish language version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (and its two sequels) that “introduced Rapace to the world”. An earlier version gave the year of the first film as 2011.

Even if it is a Jeff Bezos ego trip\\nWilliam Shatner inside a Jeff Bezos ego tri… sorry, rocket.\\nWilliam Shatner inside a Jeff Bezos ego tri… sorry, rocket. Photograph: Amazon\\nStuart Heritage\\nStuart Heritage\\n@stuheritage\\nWed 15 Dec 2021 13.48 GMT\\nLast modified on Wed 15 Dec 2021 13.49 GMT\\n\\n240\\n\\nThere are two competing schools of thought when it comes to William Shatner’s space mission. The first is characterised by a kind of awestruck wonder over the beautiful symmetry of it all: Shatner starred in Star Trek, Star Trek inspired a generation of engineers, the engineers built a rocket, the rocket flew Shatner into space. The second tends to think that letting a billionaire indulge an actor by flying him to the brink of the atmosphere in a spaceship shaped like a willy might not be the best use of our resources.\\n\\nShatner in Space is firmly for the first crowd. A 45-minute documentary about his mission, it airs on Amazon Prime. Jeff Bezos owns Amazon Prime. He also owns the rocket that Shatner flew on. Anyone expecting even an iota of criticism would be better off looking elsewhere.\\n\\nIf you watched the news coverage of William Shatner’s journey into space on Bezos’s Blue Origin spaceship, New Shepard, you’ll have a rough idea of what will happen here. A 90-year-old man, at the invitation of the world’s richest man, travels up to the edge of space and returns transformed. Upon leaving the capsule on its return to Earth, Shatner tries to grasp at the profundity of what he saw up there; wide-eyed and slack-jawed, he struggles to articulate the fragility of life on Earth. Meanwhile, Bezos cuts him off to spray some champagne around like a tinpot go-kart champion.\\nShatner’s willy-shaped spaceship.\\nShatner’s willy-shaped spaceship. Photograph: LM Otero/AP\\n\\nThe champagne moment, unsurprisingly, has been sliced out of Shatner in Space. What’s left walks a fragile line. The show is part monument to Bezos’s ego, because of course it is, but it is also an incredible document of a man at the end of his life witnessing the great beyond. If you can stomach the former, there’s a good chance that the latter will move you to tears.\\n\\nHere, Shatner acts like a man who knows his time is coming. He speaks almost exclusively with a hushed sincerity that is frequently at odds with those around him. In a quiet moment with Bezos, for example, Shatner leans in and asks if he is scared of death. Coming from anyone else, it would be a stone cold conversation killer. But Shatner’s age, and his yearning to know what’s next, can’t help but draw you in. You are for ever on his side.\\n\\nIn the run-up to the launch, Shatner shares an incredible story. When Star Trek was cancelled in the 1960s, his affectations of celebrity cratered around him. His marriage ended. He couldn’t afford a home, so he bought a truck and lived in it. And it’s from the truck that Shatner watched the moon landing. A man who had played an iconic space adventurer, watching mankind’s greatest moment at his lowest ebb. Sure, it’s probably a story he has told countless times before, and over the years it is likely to have been sanded and smoothed for maximum impact, but it lends his space trip a lovely poetry.\\n\\nThe voyage itself is equally revelatory. As the rocket reaches its highest point, and everyone is allowed to unclip themselves, most of the passengers start giggling at the sensation of weightlessness. Not Shatner, though. He clings on to the window, staring at the blackness of space, eyes wide with revelation. “That’s it,” he whispers to himself. “I’ve got it.”\\n\\nNow, part of me thinks that, if Jeff Bezos got his way, then everything that ever airs on Amazon Prime would be a variation of Shatner in Space. We’d be beaten over the head with long, lush pro-Amazon infomercials that could never really be shown anywhere else because they border so shamelessly on propaganda. But in this instance, I’m inclined to cut it a break. Shatner in Space is a document of what space means to Shatner, and what Shatner means to everyone he has inspired. The sight of him immediately postflight, crying and wrestling with the magnitude of what he has just witnessed, is indescribably touching. What an unexpected treat.',\n"," '/p/k6fmd': 'I lost more than £12,000 in a scam and the Co-operative Bank won’t resolve itA reader tells of distress caused by four-month wait for resolution\\nOnline fraud can cause victims immense distress.\\nOnline fraud can cause victims immense distress. Photograph: Alamy\\nAnna Tims\\nWed 5 Jan 2022 07.00 GMT\\nLast modified on Wed 12 Jan 2022 21.42 GMT\\n\\n354\\n\\nI fell victim to a banking scam and reported it to my bank within a couple of hours, but the transactions had already gone through and I have lost £12,650. Four months later, I’m still waiting for my bank, the Co-operative, to decide on a resolution. Without help from my family, I would be destitute. I have been unable to work for a year due to severe depression and anxiety. I’ve been recently diagnosed with autism and am awaiting a claim for the employment and support allowance. I have explained all this to the bank and told them of the distress it is causing. I had hoped the autism diagnosis would help me to understand and tackle my mental health difficulties so that I could work again, but this has smashed my confidence.\\nJK, Newcastle upon Tyne\\n\\nThis scam started with a call from a conman pretending to be from the Co-operative Bank’s fraud team, who knew enough of your personal details to trick you into trusting him. Over several hours, he persuaded you to transfer money held with Virgin Money and Halifax to your Co-op account, claiming it would evade a cyber-attack. Virgin blocked the transfer of £10,000. You were therefore told to transfer your £14,720 help-to-buy loan, held with Halifax, in two instalments. The first £10,000 went through, but Halifax blocked the second payment. The Co-op was, apparently, not so vigilant and allowed you to pay the £10,000 transferred from Halifax and the £2,600 already in your savings account to the fraudster.\\n\\nYou say you struggle with phone calls because of autism, and it was your parents, who arrived during the call, who realised it was a scam.\\n\\nIt’s concerning that the Co-op, unlike the other two banks, did not question this uncharacteristic activity. And it’s woeful that a signatory of the contingent reimbursement model (CRM) code, which pledges to refund blameless fraud victims, has left you in limbo for so long.\\n\\nThe code is clear that vulnerable customers, of which you are evidently one, should be repaid in all circumstances. Only when I questioned its adherence to the code did the bank action a refund. It said: “We have apologised and refunded the money, and we will be offering recompense for our delay.”\\n\\nReader TM wants to know what happens to the money stolen from customers like JK. “If I instruct my bank to pay £20,000 into the scammer’s account, my bank will have a record of the deposit,” he writes. “I’m assuming that the receiving bank will know who owns that account and, once alerted, will be able to act.”\\n\\nOne of the reasons the CRM code was agreed in the first place was to incentivise banks to collaborate more effectively to trace stolen funds. A major obstacle is the piecemeal way in which banks communicate with each other. In the US there is an online portal for the purpose – here, they have to rely on email.\\n\\nFraudsters are cunning. They know the security protocols banks follow, and they know how to get around them. That’s why they evade checks by paying students to allow gang members to use their bank accounts to receive stolen cash.\\n\\nChances are, your £20,000 would be paid into such an account and then swiftly transferred on through a chain of other accounts, often overseas, until the trail is muddied.\\n\\nIt’s also possible for scammers to steal a stranger’s identity and open a bank account in their name, especially since online account applications do not always require physical proof of ID.\\n\\nEnough personal information can be harvested via social media, Companies House, the Land Registry and ancestry websites to impersonate a victim and to satisfy ID checks.\\n\\nVigilance, by customers as well as by banks, is the only protection, so bear in mind that personal information heedlessly flung into cyberspace can, quite literally, be worth its weight in gold.\\n\\nEmail your.problems@observer.co.uk.

Much experimentation and data analysis later, he realised there was a fundamental relationship between force, mass and acceleration. He formulated a theory to describe that relationship – one that could be expressed as an equation, F=ma – and used it to predict the behaviour of objects other than apples. His predictions turned out to be right (if not always precise enough for those who came later).\\n\\nContrast how science is increasingly done today. Facebook’s machine learning tools predict your preferences better than any psychologist. AlphaFold, a program built by DeepMind, has produced the most accurate predictions yet of protein structures based on the amino acids they contain. Both are completely silent on why they work: why you prefer this or that information; why this sequence generates that structure.\\n\\n    Humans turn out to be deeply uncomfortable with theory-free science\\n\\nYou can’t lift a curtain and peer into the mechanism. They offer up no explanation, no set of rules for converting this into that – no theory, in a word. They just work and do so well. We witness the social effects of Facebook’s predictions daily. AlphaFold has yet to make its impact felt, but many are convinced it will change medicine.\\n\\nSomewhere between Newton and Mark Zuckerberg, theory took a back seat. In 2008, Chris Anderson, the then editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, predicted its demise. So much data had accumulated, he argued, and computers were already so much better than us at finding relationships within it, that our theories were being exposed for what they were – oversimplifications of reality. Soon, the old scientific method – hypothesise, predict, test – would be relegated to the dustbin of history. We’d stop looking for the causes of things and be satisfied with correlations.\\nNewton and his apocryphal apple tree.\\nNewton and his apocryphal apple tree. Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/Alamy\\n\\nWith the benefit of hindsight, we can say that what Anderson saw is true (he wasn’t alone). The complexity that this wealth of data has revealed to us cannot be captured by theory as traditionally understood. “We have leapfrogged over our ability to even write the theories that are going to be useful for description,” says computational neuroscientist Peter Dayan, director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Germany. “We don’t even know what they would look like.”\\n\\nBut Anderson’s prediction of the end of theory looks to have been premature – or maybe his thesis was itself an oversimplification. There are several reasons why theory refuses to die, despite the successes of such theory-free prediction engines as Facebook and AlphaFold. All are illuminating, because they force us to ask: what’s the best way to acquire knowledge and where does science go from here?\\n\\nThe first reason is that we’ve realised that artificial intelligences (AIs), particularly a form of machine learning called neural networks, which learn from data without having to be fed explicit instructions, are themselves fallible. Think of the prejudice that has been documented in Google’s search engines and Amazon’s hiring tools.\\n\\nThe second is that humans turn out to be deeply uncomfortable with theory-free science. We don’t like dealing with a black box – we want to know why.\\n\\nAnd third, there may still be plenty of theory of the traditional kind – that is, graspable by humans – that usefully explains much but has yet to be uncovered.\\n\\nSo theory isn’t dead, yet, but it is changing – perhaps beyond recognition. “The theories that make sense when you have huge amounts of data look quite different from those that make sense when you have small amounts,” says Tom Griffiths, a psychologist at Princeton University.\\n\\nGriffiths has been using neural nets to help him improve on existing theories in his domain, which is human decision-making. A popular theory of how people make decisions when economic risk is involved is prospect theory, which was formulated by behavioural economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the 1970s (it later won Kahneman a Nobel prize). The idea at its core is that people are sometimes, but not always, rational.\\nDaniel Kahneman, one of the founders of the prospect theory of human behaviour.\\nDaniel Kahneman, one of the founders of the prospect theory of human behaviour. Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer\\n\\nIn Science last June, Griffiths’s group described how they trained a neural net on a vast dataset of decisions people took in 10,000 risky choice scenarios, then compared how accurately it predicted further decisions with respect to prospect theory. They found that prospect theory did pretty well, but the neural net showed its worth in highlighting where the theory broke down, that is, where its predictions failed.\\n\\nThese counter-examples were highly informative, Griffiths says, because they revealed more of the complexity that exists in real life. For example, humans are constantly weighing up probabilities based on incoming information, as prospect theory describes. But when there are too many competing probabilities for the brain to compute, they might switch to a different strategy – being guided by a rule of thumb, say – and a stockbroker’s rule of thumb might not be the same as that of a teenage bitcoin trader, since it is drawn from different experiences.\\n\\n“We’re basically using the machine learning system to identify those cases where we’re seeing something that’s inconsistent with our theory,” Griffiths says. The bigger the dataset, the more inconsistencies the AI learns. The end result is not a theory in the traditional sense of a precise claim about how people make decisions, but a set of claims that is subject to certain constraints. A way to picture it might be as a branching tree of “if… then”-type rules, which is difficult to describe mathematically, let alone in words.\\n\\n    ‘AlphaFold will only improve our understanding of life and therapeutics’\\n\\nJanet Thornton\\n\\nWhat the Princeton psychologists are discovering is still just about explainable, by extension from existing theories. But as they reveal more and more complexity, it will become less so – the logical culmination of that process being the theory-free predictive engines embodied by Facebook or AlphaFold.\\n\\nSome scientists are comfortable with that, even eager for it. When voice recognition software pioneer Frederick Jelinek said: “Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recogniser goes up,” he meant that theory was holding back progress – and that was in the 1980s.\\n\\nOr take protein structures. A protein’s function is largely determined by its structure, so if you want to design a drug that blocks or enhances a given protein’s action, you need to know its structure. AlphaFold was trained on structures that were derived experimentally, using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and at the moment its predictions are considered more reliable for proteins where there is some experimental data available than for those where there is none. But its reliability is improving all the time, says Janet Thornton, former director of the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) near Cambridge, and it isn’t the lack of a theory that will stop drug designers using it. “What AlphaFold does is also discovery,” she says, “and it will only improve our understanding of life and therapeutics.”\\nThe structure of a human protein modelled by the AlphaFold program.\\nThe structure of a human protein modelled by the AlphaFold program.

Critics point out, for example, that neural nets can throw up spurious correlations, especially if the datasets they are trained on are small. And all datasets are biased, because scientists don’t collect data evenly or neutrally, but always with certain hypotheses or assumptions in mind, assumptions that worked their way damagingly into Google’s and Amazon’s AIs. As philosopher of science Sabina Leonelli of the University of Exeter explains: “The data landscape we’re using is incredibly skewed.”\\n\\nBut while these problems certainly exist, Dayan doesn’t think they’re insurmountable. He points out that humans are biased too and, unlike AIs, “in ways that are very hard to interrogate or correct”. Ultimately, if a theory produces less reliable predictions than an AI, it will be hard to argue that the machine is the more biased of the two.\\n\\nA tougher obstacle to the new science may be our human need to explain the world – to talk in terms of cause and effect. In 2019, neuroscientists Bingni Brunton and Michael Beyeler of the University of Washington, Seattle, wrote that this need for interpretability may have prevented scientists from making novel insights about the brain, of the kind that only emerges from large datasets. But they also sympathised. If those insights are to be translated into useful things such as drugs and devices, they wrote, “it is imperative that computational models yield insights that are explainable to, and trusted by, clinicians, end-users and industry”.\\n\\n“Explainable AI”, which addresses how to bridge the interpretability gap, has become a hot topic. But that gap is only set to widen and we might instead be faced with a trade-off: how much predictability are we willing to give up for interpretability?\\n\\nSumit Chopra, an AI scientist who thinks about the application of machine learning to healthcare at New York University, gives the example of an MRI image. It takes a lot of raw data – and hence scanning time – to produce such an image, which isn’t necessarily the best use of that data if your goal is to accurately detect, say, cancer. You could train an AI to identify what smaller portion of the raw data is sufficient to produce an accurate diagnosis, as validated by other methods, and indeed Chopra’s group has done so. But radiologists and patients remain wedded to the image. “We humans are more comfortable with a 2D image that our eyes can interpret,” he says.\\nA patient undergoing MRI scanning in Moscow.\\nA patient undergoing MRI scanning in Moscow. Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/Tass\\n\\nThe final objection to post-theory science is that there is likely to be useful old-style theory – that is, generalisations extracted from discrete examples – that remains to be discovered and only humans can do that because it requires intuition. In other words, it requires a kind of instinctive homing in on those properties of the examples that are relevant to the general rule. One reason we consider Newton brilliant is that in order to come up with his second law he had to ignore some data. He had to imagine, for example, that things were falling in a vacuum, free of the interfering effects of air resistance.\\n\\nIn Nature last month, mathematician Christian Stump, of Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, called this intuitive step “the core of the creative process”. But the reason he was writing about it was to say that for the first time, an AI had pulled it off. DeepMind had built a machine-learning program that had prompted mathematicians towards new insights – new generalisations – in the mathematics of knots.\\n\\nIn 2022, therefore, there is almost no stage of the scientific process where AI hasn’t left its footprint. And the more we draw it into our quest for knowledge, the more it changes that quest. We’ll have to learn to live with that, but we can reassure ourselves about one thing: we’re still asking the questions. As Pablo Picasso put it in the 1960s, “computers are useless. They can only give you answers.”',\n"," '/p/k8g6v': '‘A Rosetta Stone’: Australian fossil site is a vivid window into 15m-year-old rainforestLikely to contain dozens of undiscovered species, the site is so well-preserved that the contents of fish stomachs and breathing apparatus of spiders can be seen\\nby Graham Readfearn\\nFri 7 Jan 2022 19.00 GMT\\nLast modified on Fri 1 Apr 2022 09.48 BST\\n\\n39\\n\\nThe Australian paleontologist Matthew McCurry was digging for Jurassic fossils when a farmer dropped by with news of something he’d seen in his paddock – a fossilised leaf in a piece of hard brown rock.\\n\\nFossil leaves are not usually anything to write home about, but the spot was close, so McCurry and his colleague Michael Frese went to take a look.\\n\\nWhat they found in that dusty paddock near the New South Wales town of Gulgong five years ago has had paleontologists – at least those few who have known the secret – in awe.\\n\\nEncased in the rocks are the inhabitants of a rainforest that existed in that now dry and arid spot about 15m years ago.\\n\\n“There’s a whole ecosystem preserved,” says McCurry, curator of paleontology at the Australian Museum and a lecturer at the University of New South Wales.\\n\\nAs their hammers split the iron-rich rocks, thousands of fossils have been revealed – from flowering plants to fruits and seeds, insects, spiders, pollen and fish. There will be scores of new species.\\nThe research team look for insect fossils at the site in McGraths Flat, NSW, Australia\\nThe research team look for insect fossils at the site; on their first visit, McCurry and Frese found tiny aquatic insects preserved in the rock.

The huge array of leaf fossils has allowed the team to estimate the climate of the area. Photograph: Salty Dingo/Courtesy of the Australian Museum\\n\\nMcCurry and his colleagues revealed the site, and their initial findings, in the journal Science Advances on Saturday Australian time.\\n\\n“Paleontologists around the world will drool when they see this paper,” said Prof John Long, a famed fossil hunter from Flinders University who got a sneak peek at some of the fossils a year ago.\\n\\nSuch an array of specimens in one spot has allowed the Australian scientists to build an incredibly detailed picture of a little-known ecosystem from a period known as the mid-Miocene – a time just before the continent dried out to be what it is today.\\n\\nAs well as the huge number of different specimens at the site – known as McGraths Flat – it is the fossils’ immaculate preservation that is delivering an unprecedented depth of information.\\n\\nUnder a microscope, there is detail down to below a micron in width (a spider’s thread is about three microns).\\n\\nThe breathing apparatus of spiders and the contents of fish stomachs are visible. The cells that can reveal the original colour of a feather have been preserved. A sawfly was frozen in time with dozens of pollen grains attached to its head.\\nA fossil trapdoor spider from McGraths Flat\\n‘You have complete organisms ... soft tissue ... cellular preservation. There’s a spider with its breathing system beautifully preserved.’ Photograph: Michael Frese/Courtesy of the Australian Museum\\n\\nSince that first visit, McCurry and his colleagues have unearthed a treasure trove of fossils. When the rocks are broken apart, they tend to split the fossilised remains in half like an instant autopsy, revealing internal organs and tissues.\\n\\nFish stomachs are so well preserved McCurry says they can see what that fish ate – about 15m years ago – in the moments before its demise.\\n\\n“We can see the food in the stomach, like a dragonfly wing. But commonly, it’s insect larvae,” he says.\\n\\nLong saw some of the fossils last year when he visited McCurry at the Australian Museum.\\n\\n“Fossils are often preserved as bits and pieces or fragments. Occasionally you might get a whole organism. But this is truly exceptional preservation,” he says.\\n\\n“You have complete organisms ... soft tissue ... cellular preservation. There’s a spider with its breathing system beautifully preserved. It’s a Xanadu.\\n\\n“There’s all the diversity with a great range of organisms from fungi to plants and fish, and also you have their interaction. There’s evidence of behaviour. It has all the attributes of a world-class fossil deposit, of which we have very, very few in Australia.”\\n\\n“It’s a bit of a Rosetta Stone of the full ecology of this middle Miocene environment. We have no other window into that period that tells us what that part of Australia was like.”\\nFortunate fossils\\n\\nNew fossil sites are rare finds, and this one was almost missed. McCurry admits he drove past it at least once, oblivious to what was there.\\n\\nOn his first visit with Frese they found rocks rich in iron, unusually hard to split, and of a type not known for preserving fossils.\\n\\nBut immediately, the pair found what they thought were aquatic insects. Using a microscope Frese had in his car, they could see tiny midges preserved. “That’s when we realised how special the fossils were,” McCurry says.\\nAssociate professor Michael Frese splitting rocks to find fossils in McGraths Flats, NSW, Australia\\nAssociate professor Michael Frese, who has been examining the fossils for several years, says he is blown away by their detail. Photograph: Salty Dingo/Courtesy of the Australian Museum\\n\\nFinding fossilised pollen allowed the scientists to accurately date the site.\\n\\nLittle is known about the ecosystems of the mid-Miocene period.\\n\\nMcCurry says there are likely to be “dozens, if not hundreds” of species new to science that have already been collected. The researchers have found probable new species preserved in the rock deposit between 50cm and 80cm thick at a rate of more than one a day. There have been eight field excavations so far.\\nAn electron microscopy image of a single pentagonal pollen grain\\nNothofagidites pollen grain.

Photograph: Michael Frese/Courtesy of the Australian Museum\\n\\nEven though only two square metres are excavated each time, about 2,000 specimens have been collected. Now follows the painstaking process of checking each one against known records of flora and fauna.\\n\\nUsing analysis of the huge array of plant leaves at the site, the team have even been able to estimate the climate of the area. Warm months were about 26C and cool months as low as 7C.\\n\\nAlmost a metre of rain would have fallen in a month in the wet season – the region’s modern climate is hotter but much drier, with the wettest month averaging just 70mm.\\nFeather fossil\\n\\nWhile much of the team go through the vast array of flora and fauna, Dr Jacqueline Nguyen, an expert in the evolution of birds at the Australian Museum, has been mostly fixated on the only evidence found so far of the birds that were in the rainforest. That is, one single fossilised feather about the size of a fingerprint.\\n\\n“Fossilised feathers are incredibly rare,” she says. “Most are from the Cretaceous, but from the Miocene we only have this one. I’m super excited.”\\n\\nThe fossil feather is so detailed that Nguyen and her colleagues have been able to see the parts of the cells that give the feather its colour. This feather – probably from the bird’s body rather than wing – was likely dark or iridescent.\\n\\n“Even though it’s just one feather, it’s a tantalising hint at what’s to come. Maybe we’ll find a bird skeleton.”\\nA fossilised feather, which appears yellow against the brown rock it is in\\n‘Fossilised feathers are incredibly rare,’ says Dr Jacqueline Nguyen. In this one, roughly the size of a fingerprint, parts of cells that gave the feather its colour have been identified. Photograph: Michael Frese/Courtesy of the Australian Museum\\n\\nFrese, who is a virologist by training, has been examining the fossils under microscopes for several years.\\n\\n“I was blown away by the detail,” he says. “I love the way the fossils present themselves. Usually you just see the surface, but here it always splits in half and you see the inside of a spider leg or the inside of pollen.”\\n\\nThe secret to the fossils’ preservation is up for debate, but McCurry thinks it would have happened over hundreds of years rather than in a sudden event.\\n\\nIron-rich water, maybe from nearby outcrops, could have flowed into a shallow billabong, periodically deoxygenating the water, killing the organisms or encasing flora and fauna in sediment that turns into the rocks found in the field.\\n\\nMcCurry admits he’s relieved to be able to tell the world about the discovery.\\n\\n“This has been a marathon,” he says. “It’s a really important find and it’s going to keep us going for a long time.”',\n"," '/p/km74p': \"I'm still repaying my repaid student loanMy account says I owe £12,000 and the Student Loans Company has deducted £1,089 over two months\\nMoney is still being deducted from earnings even though the loan has been settled.\\nMoney is still being deducted from earnings even though the loan has been settled.

Photograph: Ricardo Mazalán/AP\\nAli Martin at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium\\n@Cricket_Ali\\nWed 9 Mar 2022 22.18 GMT\\nLast modified on Thu 10 Mar 2022 10.19 GMT\\n\\n356\\n\\nInsipid with the new ball but at least determined thereafter, England began life on the road without Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad and on a stop-start second day of this first Test they required the generosity of their hosts for the incisions that came their way.\\n\\nWhen the latest in a succession of squally showers brought the close, West Indies were 202 for four from 66.5 overs, 109 runs behind after Jonny Bairstow’s eventual 140 had helped England stick 311 on the board first up. Nkrumah Bonner, the late-blooming Jamaican No 4, was 34 not out from 103 balls, while Jason Holder responded to his elevation to No 6 with typical diligence and an unbeaten 43 from 104.\\nEngland's captain Joe Root, right, talks to bowler Mark Wood during day two at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground\\n‘It’s weird’: Mark Wood admits feeling absence of Anderson and Broad\\nRead more\\n\\nThough Anderson and Broad operating in tandem away from home may be one veteran too many these days, England’s decision to omit both from this tour has cast a long shadow over their replacements. It has also left Joe Root, a captain in desperate need of results after just one win from his last 14 matches, with no bankers.\\n\\nIt would be too soon to draw hard conclusions but against weaker opposition than the Australia side that forced this drastic change, this was a disappointing start. Chris Woakes, now the leader of the attack, found a consistent line elusive and went at four and a half runs an over for his one wicket, while Craig Overton is hardworking but not as skilful as Ollie Robinson, whose back spasms opened up the spot.\\n\\nInstead it was the Durham pairing of Mark Wood and Ben Stokes who looked likeliest, enjoying reverse and conventional swing respectively. That said, the latter’s deployment for nine overs raised eyebrows after the pre-match chat that his return from a side strain would need him to be used sparingly. Root had little choice.\\n\\nBoth did manage to stem the flow. So too Jack Leach, who looks to have a first-innings plan and drift from the Caribbean breeze. In Bonner and Holder they met stiff, orthodox resistance. The latter’s double century in Barbados three years ago remains burned on English retina but West Indies (in theory) have a long tail and also bat last. As such, day three will begin pregnant with possibilities.\\n\\nThe names of Anderson and Broad cannot have been far from the lips of the travelling supporters at lunch as they made their way to the various bars and jerk shacks that line the grass banks on either side of the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. West Indies had won the first session, knocking over the final four English wickets for a cost of 43 runs – Bairstow was the last man out to a fine swirling catch from Holder before rightly lapping up the applause – with the openers Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell then cruising to 44 for no loss in the space of 10 overs.\\n\\nEngland had at least passed 300 for the first time in 10 innings this winter. That said, this slightly meagre milestone was achieved thanks to Holder putting down a much simpler chance off his own bowling when Bairstow had 126 after Jayden Seales had removed Woakes (28) and Overton (0) in the space of three deliveries.\\nRain clouds gather over the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on day two\\nRain clouds gather over the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on day two. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images\\n\\nBut the response that followed was not inspiring, Root forced to use four bowlers before the interval as Woakes and Overton struggled to replicate their decorated forebears. The analysts at CricViz had this down as England’s third least threatening new-ball burst in the past decade but good old eyesight was enough here.\\n\\nNeedless to say Anderson and Broad were in situ for the two ranked lower but on a couple of heartbreaking pitches at the MCG and the SCG during the 2017-18 Ashes tour; this surface, though slow, did offer a bit of nibble with the harder ball when West Indies bowled and the Dukes ball, though different to that in England, does swing.\\n\\nThis creeping dread continued into the early afternoon, Brathwaite shedding his barnacle tag with the fastest of his 33 scores above 50 in Test cricket. Last year one of the horses he owns, War Eagle, claimed victory in the 81st Barbados Derby and the West Indies captain flew out of the traps himself here, drilling seven fours and one booming straight six off Leach that shocked all who have followed his career.\\n\\nEngland had hit the session with fresh energy, at least, and though not every move from Root made sense – such as Woakes bowling from the Sir Curtly Ambrose End, when the breeze was going against his outswinger – they went on to take four precious wickets through some limp batting from their hosts. First came a gift from Campbell, the aggressive Jamaican left-hander who had the temerity to ramp Anderson three years ago. He had just pulled Overton for a thundering four to reach 35, only to then glove a slightly shorter delivery from the Somerset man down leg. Then went Brathwaite, reaching for a wide, albeit 91mph, delivery from Wood that was almost guided to Overton at gully like it was catching practice.\\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\\n\\nStokes then teased an edge to slip off Shamarh Brooks on 18, getting away swing from the Sir Andy Roberts End and meeting a loose drive. And though Ben Foakes had put down Jermaine Blackwood off Wood on nought – a tough one-handed chance down to his left from an inside edge – Woakes soon ended a personally chastening session with an inside edge off the Jamaican that flew to gully off the thigh pad. West Indies were 127 for four at tea and still 184 runs in arrears.\\n\\nBut in between cloudbursts during the evening session, Bonner and Holder gutsed it out and the ball went soft. No chance was offered in their unbroken stand of 75 that was mindful of Leach in particular; along with an economy under two, the left-armer got the odd one to grip in a way that augurs well for England come the fourth innings.\",\n"," 'b2052032': 'Spain reverses plan to open up to unvaccinated British visitorsClose\\n\\nRelated video: Spain opens up to unvaccinated British travellers\\nLeer en Español\\n\\nIn an extraordinary reversal of an earlier announcement, the Spanish tourist board in London has withdrawn the promise of opening up to unvaccinated British visitors.\\n\\nOn Wednesday the tourist board said Spain had opened up to all UK travellers with immediate effect, saying unjabbed visitors would be able to enter with a negative pre-departure test.\\n\\nBut eight hours later travellers were told this was incorrect, and that the announcement resulted from an error of interpretation of the official state bulletin.\\n\\nUK travellers aged 12 and above are still required to show proof of being fully vaccinated or a certificate of recovery (dated no more than 180 days previously).\\n\\nPedro Medina, deputy director of the Spanish tourist office in the UK said: “We apologise unreservedly for the miscommunication earlier today which was due to a misunderstanding of the new entry requirements.”\\nRecommended\\n\\n    EasyJet and BA cancel more than 100 flights - live updates\\n    EasyJet and BA cancel more than 100 flights - live updates \\n\\nThe only exception is for those aged 12 to 17 (inclusive) who can show a negative Covid test (PCR or similar) taken within the 72 hours before arriving in Spain.\\n\\nListen to Simon Calder’s latest travel podcast about the Spain rules U-turn.\\n\\nFor vaccinated travellers, the Spanish tourist office said “If more than 270 days have passed since the final dose, certification of a booster vaccination is also required, except for teenagers aged 12 to 17 inclusive.”\\n\\nOne less significant change has been confirmed: children under 12 and those travelling to Spain with an NHS Covid travel pass no longer need to complete Spain’s health control form prior to arrival.\\nmulti trivia two icon\\nSponsored Ad\\nUp next\\nThe Independent Weekly Quiz\\nApester Logo\\n✕\\nmulti trivia two icon\\nSponsored Ad\\nUp next\\nundefined\\nApester Logo\\nmulti trivia two icon\\nSponsored Ad\\nUp next\\nundefined\\nApester Logo\\nmulti trivia two icon\\nSponsored Ad\\nUp next\\nundefined\\nApester Logo\\n\\nTo take advantage of the “previous infection” option, the traveller must have a recovery certificate “issued by the official authorities”.

And Max Scherzer watched from the dugout, absolutely aching for his next start.

So just 15 games into this season, there are important questions: “Who are these guys?” dovetails with “Why should I come to the ballpark?”\\n\\nLong balls burn the Nationals, who settle for a split with the D’backs\\n\\n“Losing is never fun,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said before his team dropped a 4-3 decision to the Arizona Diamondbacks. “It never is. It goes against everything you’ve ever been brought up in this game to do.”\\n\\nWhat is being required of Nationals fans right now is to remember what it was like around here in the summers of, say, 2009 and 2010. There has to be joy in discovering the players who might not help them win a game on a particular night in 2022 but could be a major contributor in a season with more promise. Josiah Gray and Joan Adon combined for 11⅔ innings of one-run ball in a Tuesday doubleheader sweep. Keibert Ruiz had two hits Wednesday and two more Thursday. There are glimmers there: Maybe that’s 40 percent of a dominant, rebuilt rotation in 2024 and the switch-hitting catcher who will handle the staff.\\n\\nA pitcher and a catcher and the start of a new era of Nationals baseball\\n\\n“When you see a 23-year-old starting pitcher like Adon, when you see a 24-year-old pitcher like Gray — rookies this year,” Rizzo said, “and you see Cole Henry in Double A pitching well, you see [Cade] Cavalli in Triple A knocking on the door, you see the remnants of what we discovered back in ’08, ’09, ’10.”\\n\\nRemember what it was like when Ian Desmond came up in September 2009, hit .280 with seven doubles, two triples and four homers, and suddenly you thought, “He could be the shortstop on a division winner”? Remember what it was like in June 2010, when Strasburg made his 14-strikeout, biggest-event-in-baseball debut, and you allowed yourself to wonder, “Could he someday be a World Series MVP?”\\nNationals Manager Dave Martinez. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\\n\\nTransport yourself back. The years from 2012 to 2019 brought five postseason appearances, a World Series championship, plus more regular season wins than every team but the Dodgers. Don’t lament that they’re gone. Embrace that they’re a possibility again. A far-off possibility, sure — but what’s baseball without hope?\\n\\n“I always talk about being where your feet are, right?” Manager Dave Martinez said. “More so now than ever before, you really got to focus on the day at hand and teaching. … It’s about growth and watching these young kids get an opportunity to play and watch them grow, watch them mature and evaluate and see where we’re at and try to figure out where they’re going to be by the end of the year and who they can be.”\\n\\nAs a boy, he jotted down his goals and ambitions. Now Cade Cavalli's dreams are becoming reality.\\n\\nThere is faith involved in all that for managers and executives. There’s also faith for fans. It can be a tough sell. The attendance for the four games of this series against Arizona: 9,621, 11,720, 15,774 and 14,424. The first — played Tuesday afternoon after a rainout Monday night — was the smallest announced crowd for a Nationals game since baseball returned to Washington in 2005 (excluding 2020 and 2021, when there were limitations on crowd size amid the pandemic). The others ranked fifth-, 30th- and 16th-smallest. A message for the summer: There are plenty of good seats available.\\n\\nSome things to know about attendance: The number announced for any game is not people through the turnstiles but rather tickets sold. So in general, the smallest crowd of the year can provide a general idea of the season ticket base — such a vital sign of a club’s connection with its fans, not to mention a key revenue stream. There are caveats — season ticket holders can exchange seats for any game and get extras for a game later in the season — so don’t draw numerical conclusions. But this is true: The Nationals don’t draw as many fans as they once did, and it’s not close.\\n\\nSvrluga: Why owning a baseball team isn’t like owning a shopping mall\\n\\nThe reasons for all the empty seats are legion. The pandemic meant the Nationals had zero chance to capitalize — at the gate — on their World Series title. The performance of the 2021 team means almost all of the familiar faces are gone. Plus — and this is important — the uncertainty about when the season would start because of the lockout meant not only that single-game tickets went on sale late but fans had an open invitation not to be engaged with the sport at a time when they should have been gearing up for Opening Day. There was real damage done — and not just in Washington.\\n\\nLinking attendance to a team’s preseason hopes or to its current record is folly. It’s much more complicated. But it’s also true that the Nats once employed a pitcher whose visage was so well-known and understood that they could paint only his eyes — one blue, one brown — on an elevator shaft in right field, and everybody in the ballpark knew Scherzer was watching over them.\\n\\nThis is an adjustment — for everyone. What to look for?\\n(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\\n\\n“This is such a valuable experience for these young guys — even in defeat sometimes,” Rizzo said. “It’s a learning process every time. You’ve seen Adon take steps forward. You’re going to see him take steps backward, too. Same with Gray. You’re going to see Ruiz start off hitting [.320] in his first six games and then struggle a little bit. But what you’re seeing is the core of young players that will be part of the next championship club.”\\n\\nThat might be so. But day after day after day, there will be bumps.\\n\\n“You don’t rebuild up here,” Martinez said after the Nats failed to take the series, squandering opportunities in the eighth and ninth innings Thursday. “… We’re trying to develop winners.”\\n\\nWhat’s left when a franchise rebuilds? A fan base with questions.\\n\\nThe key word: develop. In the bottom of the eighth Thursday, Ruiz came to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs. In position to be the hero, he swung at the first pitch, a high fastball — and popped it up into foul territory. Ruiz didn’t leave the batter’s box until he had slammed his bat in the dirt.\\n\\n“Keibert, he’s a high-ball hitter,” Martinez said. “I think that one was just a little bit too high for him.”\\n\\nLive and learn, all season long. There might not be hope for many wins in 2022. The hope has to lie in discovering the players who will provide them in the future.\",\n"," 20220424: 'Cristiano Ronaldo scores landmark goal days after death of infant sonCristiano Ronaldo raised his left arm and pointed toward the sky following his goal for Manchester United on Saturday that gave the Portugal star his 100th in English Premier League competition.\\n\\nThe subdued celebration unfolded five days after he and his partner, Georgina Rodriguez, announced one of their newborn twins had died.

I got frustrated and lost control over my behavior. I know these words cannot undo my wrongdoings. In the future I promise to make better choices.\\n\\n\"I’m not only apologizing to Nate Tenaglia but also tom my teammates, the coaching staff, the University and the whole basketball community.”\\n\\nAfter the video of the incident went viral on Wednesday, punishments for Platt were announced by Fitchburg State and the Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference, which rescinded the player of the week award the junior guard won this week.\\n\\n“We are appalled by the actions of the student-athlete,” the conference said in a statement. Platt’s name does not appear on Fitchburg State’s online roster or the team’s statistics.\\n\\n    The MASCAC and Fitchburg State University take this incident very seriously. We are appalled by the actions of the student-athlete. He has been indefinitely suspended from the team and barred from campus.

The MASCAC has also vacated his player of the week award. His behavior goes against the MASCAC’s mission which includes good sportsmanship. (2 of 3)\\n    — MASCAC (@mascacsports) November 14, 2018\\n\\n    On behalf of the MASCAC and Fitchburg State, we apologize to the Nichols College student-athlete, the team and institution.\\n    — MASCAC (@mascacsports) November 14, 2018\\n\\n“The Fitchburg State community is appalled by the conduct displayed during Tuesday night’s home basketball game. The player involved has been indefinitely suspended from the team and barred from campus, effective immediately,” the school said in its statement. “His behavior is antithetical to our community values and good sportsmanship. Fitchburg State does not tolerate behavior that violates those standards. The case is being reviewed at the student conduct level for consideration of further sanctions.”\\n\\nTenaglia “was able to complete the game, and we continue to monitor his health,” Nichols Athletic Director Chris Colvin said in a statement. “We are proud of the way our student-athletes handled the incident and that they did not allow it to escalate.”\\n\\nColvin said that Fitchburg State was “handling the matter” of Platt’s punishment.\\n\\nA spokesman for Nichols, Pete Divito, told ESPN that Platt was frustrated for much of the game by Tenaglia’s defense but that there “was no real setup to this.” According to Divito, it was a good thing Tenaglia’s teammates did not see the incident, or the situation could have gotten more ugly.\\n\\n“We’re happy it didn’t escalate into a brawl,” Divito said.\\n\\nHere’s another look at the entire sequence from the game broadcast:\\n\\nAs seen in the second video and the full game broadcast, the trailing official appeared to witness the punch and whistled Platt for a foul; according to reports, Platt was also ejected. Tenaglia, who tested negative for a concussion (per ESPN), remained in the game and made the two free throws that immediately followed his three-pointer. Platt, who led the Falcons with 16 points, had been called for a technical foul early in the first half — from the broadcast, he appeared to get in a Nichols player’s face after blocking a shot — and NCAA rules state a player can be ejected for accumulating two technical fouls or one Flagrant 2 foul.\\n\\n“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” Tenaglia’s high school coach, Phil Conners, told the Sentinel & Enterprise, saying that he was watching the game via a live stream. “Biggest cheap shot I’ve ever seen.\"',\n"," 61171529: 'Ukraine war: World Bank warns of \\'human catastrophe\\' food crisisThe world faces a \"human catastrophe\" from a food crisis arising from Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, World Bank president David Malpass has said.\\n\\nHe told the BBC that record rises in food prices would push hundreds of millions people into poverty and lower nutrition, if the crisis continues.\\n\\nThe World Bank calculates there could be a \"huge\" 37% jump in food prices.\\n\\nThis would hit the poor hardest, who will \"eat less and have less money for anything else such as schooling\".\\n\\nIn an interview with BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, Mr Malpass, who leads the institution charged with global alleviation of poverty, said the impact on the poor made it \"an unfair kind of crisis... that was true also of Covid\".\\n\\n\"It\\'s a human catastrophe, meaning nutrition goes down. But then it also becomes a political challenge for governments who can\\'t do anything about it, they didn\\'t cause it and they see the prices going up,\" he said on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington.\\n\\n    Ukraine war causes \\'giant leap\\' in food prices\\n\\n    Ukraine war \\'catastrophic for global food\\'\\n\\nThe price rises are broad and deep, he said: \"It\\'s affecting food of all different kinds oils, grains, and then it gets into other crops, corn crops, because they go up when wheat goes up\".\\n\\nThere was enough food in the world to feed everybody, he said, and global stockpiles are large by historical standards, but there will have to be a sharing or sales process to get the food to where it is needed.\\n\\nMr Malpass also discouraged countries from subsidising production or capping prices.\\n\\nInstead, he said, the focus needed to be on increasing supplies across the world of fertilisers and food, alongside targeted assistance for the very poorest people.\\n\\nThe World Bank chief also warned of a knock on \"crisis within a crisis\" arising from the inability of developing countries to service their large pandemic debts, amid rising food and energy prices.\\n\\n\"This is a very real prospect. It\\'s happening for some countries, we don\\'t know how far it\\'ll go. As many as 60% of the poorest countries right now are either in debt distress or at high risk of being in debt distress,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We have to be worried about a debt crisis, the best thing to do is to start early to act early on finding ways to reduce the debt burden for countries that are on have unsustainable debt, the longer you put it off, the worse it is,\" he added.\\n2px presentational grey line\\nAnalysis box by Faisal Islam, economics editor\\n\\nThe acknowledgement by the World Bank president that we have to be worried about a developing country debt crisis, is very significant.\\n\\nThe combination of massive pandemic debts with rising interest rates, and rising prices is truly toxic.\\n\\nThe talk on the sidelines here at the IMF and World Bank meetings is that the rich countries told emerging economies not to worry about borrowing in order to spend to help suppress the pandemic.\\n\\nNow those countries are wondering if these record debts will be written off.\\n\\nCampaigning groups are preparing mobilisations over a pandemic debt jubilee. But there is silence from the rich country lenders, so far.\\n\\nAnd there is a very new dynamic these days. The bankers to whom these sums are owed are no longer just in the West.\\n\\nChina is now, very broadly, owed as much as the entire collection of Western creditors known as the Paris Club.\\n\\nHow will it respond to calls for leniency on the repayment of loans?\\n\\nMr Malpass says of China: \"They have different rules, for example, contracts that have non-disclosure clauses, meaning you can\\'t share the terms with other people that makes it very hard to restructure those debts\".\\n\\nChina has also secured its lending against ports and natural resources. Sri Lanka is a case in point right now.\\n\\nThe unwinding of all of this might not be orderly, and could have significant geopolitical consequences.\\n2px presentational grey line\\n\\nEarlier this month, the United Nations said that the Ukraine war had led to a \"giant leap\" in food prices, as they hit a new record high in March.\\n\\nIt came as the war cut off supplies from the world\\'s biggest exporter of sunflower oil and the cost of alternatives climbed.\\n\\nUkraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat which have risen sharply in price too.\\n\\nThe UN said \"war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils\".\\n\\nThe UN Food Prices Index tracks the world\\'s most-traded food commodities - measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar.\\n\\nFood prices are at their highest since records began 60 years ago, according to the index, after they jumped nearly 13% in March, following February\\'s record high.\\n\\nFood commodity prices were already at 10-year highs before the war in Ukraine, according to the index, because of global harvest issues.'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}],"source":["newscontent = pd.read_excel('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alcoris0987/DTA-Thesis/main/newscontent.xlsx')\n","newscontent = dict((v, k,) for k, v in newscontent.values)\n","newscontent"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["newstitle = pd.read_excel('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alcoris0987/DTA-Thesis/main/newstitle.xlsx')\n","newstitle = dict((v, k,) for k, v in newstitle.values)\n","newstitle"],"metadata":{"id":"jUzMKY8T7uVz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1692584536995,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"Isaac Cho","userId":"09283331439017932222"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"f72ef067-dfcc-4485-cf98-ce67a51ea6aa"},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'/p/jpnd3': 'Books that explain the world: Guardian writers share their best nonfiction reads of the year',\n"," '/p/kxdhg': 'Could he?
